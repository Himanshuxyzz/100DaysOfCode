# Day 16
In Day 16 we learn about Conditional Statements (```else if```)in JavaScript.

## Conditional Statements
- ```else if ``` the else if statement is an extension to the if statement that allows you to create as many checks (conditional statements) as you want in one big block of if statement code. <br>

#### Syntax:
```
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```
