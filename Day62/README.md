# Day 62
In Day 62 we learn about  function in JavaScript.

### Function
* A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
* A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

**Syntax**
```
function name(parameter) {
// code to be executed
}
```
* Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
* Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
