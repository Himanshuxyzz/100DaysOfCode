# Day 27
In Day 27 we learn about Jumps in JavaScript.

### Jump statements
Jump statements cause an unconditional jump to another statement elsewhere in the code. They are used primarily to interrupt switch statements and loops.

### The return statement
The ```return``` statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.

**Syntax:**
```return value;```
