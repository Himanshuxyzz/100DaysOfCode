# Day 38
In Day 38 we learn about Property Getters and Setters in JavaScript.

### Getter 
The ```get``` syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up.
**Syntax**
```
{get prop() { ... } }
{get [expression]() { ... } }
```

### Setter
The ```set``` syntax binds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property.
**Syntax**
```
{set prop(val) { . . . }}
{set [expression](val) { . . . }}
```
