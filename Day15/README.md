# Day 15
In Day 15 we learn about Conditional Statements in JavaScript.

## Conditional Statements
- ```if```: use to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not. <br>
#### Syntax:
```
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

- ```if-else```: use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.<br>
#### Syntax:
```
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else { 
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

- ```nested-if```: it means an if statement inside an if statement. <br>
#### Syntax:
```
if (condition1) 
{
   // Executes when condition1 is true
   if (condition2) 
   {
      // Executes when condition2 is true
   }
}
```
