# Day 6
In Day 6 we learn about JavaScript identifiers.

## JavaScript Identifiers
In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).

### The rules for legal names are: 
1. Identifiers can only contain letters, numbers, underscore (_) and the dollar sign ($).
2. Identifiers cannot start with a number.
3. Identifiers are case-sensitive.
4. Identifiers can be any length.
5. Donâ€™t use words similar to reserved words
