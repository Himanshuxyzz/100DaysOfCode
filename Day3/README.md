# Day3
In Day 3 we learn about literals and variable declaration.
A variable is a literal assigned to an identifier, so you can reference and use it later in the program.

## Declaration Types:
* var
* let
* const

### var syntax:
```
var x; // declaration and initialization
x = "Hello World"; // assignment

// or all in one
var y = "Hello World";
```

### let syntax:
```
let x; // declaration and initialization
x = "Hello World"; // assignment

// or all in one
let y = "Hello World";
```

### const syntax:
```
const x = "Hello World";
```
