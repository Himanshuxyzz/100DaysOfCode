# Day 30
In Day 30 we learn about Object in JavaScript.

### Objects
In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

### Objects and properties
A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.  The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. 
You access the properties of an object with:
```
objectName.propertyName
```
OR: 
```
objectName["propertyName"]
```
