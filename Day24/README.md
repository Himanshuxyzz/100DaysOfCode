# Day 24
In Day 24 we learn about Jumps in JavaScript.

### Jump statements
Jump statements cause an unconditional jump to another statement elsewhere in the code. They are used primarily to interrupt switch statements and loops.

### The continue statement
The ```continue``` statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
