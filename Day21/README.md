# Day 21
In Day 21 we learn about Loop (```do/while```) in JavaScript.

### JavaScript Loops
Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

* ```do/while```: loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true

Syntax:
```
do {
  //code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```
