# Day 45
In Day 45 we learn about Reading and Accessing elements in JavaScript.

### Access the Elements of an Array
Access an array element by referring to the index number.<br>
Each element in an array is given an index, which is an integer value between 0 and one less than the length of the array. The first element has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.

**syntax:**
```
arrayName[index]
```
