# Day 31
In Day 31 we learn about Object with method in JavaScript.


### Object Methods
Object Methods in JavaScript can be accessed by using functions. Functions in JavaScript are stored as property values. 

- In a method, ```this``` refers to the owner object.

**Syntax:**
```
objectName.methodName()
```
